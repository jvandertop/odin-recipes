<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My wife tried to tell me not to submit this recipe... he doesn't want the whole world to know about it, but I say share what you have! Serve with warm tortilla chips and a nice large mojito. Top with sour cream or creme fraiche if desired.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breats</li> 
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large white onion, chopped, divided</li>
    <li>3 limes, juiced</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped cilantro, divided</li>
    <li>2 jalapeno peppers, halved and thinly sliced</li>

    <li>3 large firm-ripe avocados, cut into chunks</li>
    <li>1/4 cup crumbled queso fresco, or to taste</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add chicken; boil until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Run cool water over chicken to speed cooling process. Shred or finely slice chicken.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add 1/2 onion, lime juice, 1/2 cup cilantro, jalapeno peppers, and garlic until onion is slightly greenish in color, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Combine 4 cups water and bouillon powder in a small bowl. Pour into the pot. Let cook until just heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir chicken into the pot.</li>
    <li>Ladle soup into 4 bowls. Top with remaining 1/2 onion, 1/2 cup cilantro, avocado, and queso fresco.</li>
